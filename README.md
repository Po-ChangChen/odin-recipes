So far, I have learned the basics of how to use git, github, linux environment commands (I'm using WSL2), and html. I will now create a website to discuss a recipe. I think I am going to make a recipe on boba milk tea because I recently drank this. I will add recipes on brown sugar milk tea and also taro milk tea. This is also my first website pretty cool haha. \

Added css to the website, it looks much better!
